			<p>Over the holiday weekend I&rsquo;ve made some major changes to this blog! <em>Retroactive apology to anyone who had bookmarked anything on this site!</em></p>
<p>Prior to this weekend; I&rsquo;ve been running a pretty hacked version of WordPRess on a budget host. Frankly, it was mostly fine but I&rsquo;d noticed some downtime here and there, and once in a while they&rsquo;d just be <em>slow.</em> Overall for the price I was paying, they were great.</p>
<p>However, I finally made the jump to move off WordPress and to Jekyll.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m really pleased with the move. Flat-file; no need for a DB for a site that ostensibly does not need it. Markdown for blog posts. Integrates with CI (I&rsquo;ll put together another post later, but I&rsquo;m running a full blown CI setup with Jenkins, Git, and AWS - really happy)</p>
<h3 id="so-hows-the-site-setup">So how&rsquo;s the site setup?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Files:</strong> AWS S3 Bucket Setup for Static Page Hosting</li>
<li><strong>CDN:</strong> AWS CloudFront is acting as the CDN for this site; lightning fast!</li>
<li><strong>DNS:</strong> Now using Route53 instead of NameCheap&rsquo;s DNS services</li>
<li><strong>CI:</strong> Jenkins, polling a Git repo hosted in AWS CodeCommit; <code>master</code> branch is the production site - built automatically on any commit to the master branch; <code>staging</code> branch is published to my staging site on every commit to the staging branch</li>
</ul>
<p>No code to share today; more or less just a post to say &ldquo;This blog has changed a bit!&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll do a writeup of configuring Jenkins for CI in tandem with Jekyll in the near term.</p>
