      <title>Initial Release of Route53 DynamicDNS Client</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s many Dynamic DNS clients; some support Route53. All of them seem to have a bunch of dependencies or be platform specific. Go is really good for this, so why not cook something up really quick?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Terraform - Psuedu Nested For-Loop and Usergen Release</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So. I am using Terraform to generate a bunch of users and wanted to modularize it as much as possible. I wanted to get to a point where I could provide a set of &lt;code&gt;aws_iam_user&lt;/code&gt; objects and &lt;code&gt;aws_iam_user_policy_attachments&lt;/code&gt; and have the module cleanly handle this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Connecting Ubiquiti EdgeRouter to AWS VPC</title>
      <link>https://i-py.com/posts/2015-08-03-aws_edgerouter/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m of the mind that many small businesses can benefit greatly from extending their IT systems into the cloud. AWS is price effective (especially on a 1 year reserved term), and offers built-in VPN connectivity options via their VPC.</description>
